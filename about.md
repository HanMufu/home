#About Me

I am a master student at Rutgers University. Previously, I worked at Dell EMC and Getti Tech as a software engineer intern. 

I am a passionate Software Developer and System Engineer. My main programming languages are: **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and I am a wizard of **Backend Development**, **System Design**, **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. I am always looking to learn and contribute to something new.

My choice of IDE is **VSCode**, **InteliJ** and **PyCharm**. If I work remotely over `ssh` I can **Vim** my way around. 

Outside of CS, I like playing basketball :basketball: and workout.
