# About me

I am currently a master student at Rutgers University. Previously, I worked at Dell EMC and Getti Tech as a software engineer intern. 

I am a passionate Software Developer and System Engineer. My main programming languages are **Java** and **Python**. My interest centers on **Backend Development**, **System Design** and **Machine Learning**. Specific topics include **Scalable High Performance Web Application**, **Microservices** and **Distributed Systems**. And I am always looking to learn and contribute to something new.

My choice of IDE is **IntelliJ**, **PyCharm** and **VSCode**. If I work remotely over `ssh` I can **Vim** my way around. 

Outside of Computer Science, I like playing basketball and workout.
